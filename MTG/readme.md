PLEASE DO "new library' FIRST BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE!
Please backup your files, always. This is a bodged program.
rollback.sqlite is available in case something awful happened when running your program (like accidentally mass deleting your entire database).
If you need to rollback from the last execution, delete "library.sqlite" and rename "rollback.sqlite" to "library.sqlite".

Program notes:
Any time the program requests for an id, it does not screen whether the id was previously shown.
This means that it is possible to summon any id at any interface of the appropriate type, provided it exists.
IT ALSO MEANS YOU CAN ACCIDENTALLY DELETE AN ID YOU DON'T WANT IN THE CHECKUP MENU, AND THE DELETE MENU
Be careful.
